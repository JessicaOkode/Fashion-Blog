                        <P>There are many factors to consider when mixing prints. Nonetheless, the holy grail for all beginner mixers is to make sure that the prints have a common color. 
                    You want to choose a color that’s consistent throughout the pieces you are mixing. It really doesn’t matter if the patterns of the print are different. 
                    The shared color will help to bring the different patterns to common ground and unify the entire look. 
                    In fact, to keep it safe, the base color of your Ankara print should be the theme of your mixed Ankara fashion outfits.</P>
